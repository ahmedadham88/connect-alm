# connect-alm
This repo contains a chrome extension project done with JavaScript, HTML and CSS on the front-end and Django Framework on the back-end communicating between them with RESTful web services.

We built Ericsson's Internal Social Network for tracking tasks between colleagues to facilitate the everyday workflow. The application is a chrome extension called (ALM Connect). It connects to the backend (Django Framework) that connects to Ericsson's task monitoring tool (OpenALM) and updates the front-end regularly with any updates of the tasks statuses to be displayed to the user. The user can follow/unfollow his colleagues (e.g. within his team) and receive their updates instantly.
